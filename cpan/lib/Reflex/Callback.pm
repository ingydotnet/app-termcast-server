=head1 NAME

Reflex::Callback - Generic callback adapters to simplify calling back

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.099, released on April 21, 2013.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Varies.  See individual Reflex::Callback subclasses.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Reflex::Callback and its subclasses implement the different types of
calbacks that Reflex supports.  Reflex::Callbacks provides convenience
functions that are almost always used instead of Reflex::Callback
objects.

Reflex::Callback's generic interface is a constructor and a single
method, deliver(), which routes its parameters to their destination.
Subclasses may implement additional methods to support specific use
cases.

=head2 new

Constructor parameters vary from one subclass to another.

=head2 deliver

All deliver() methods take two positional parameters: the name of an
event being delivered, and a hashref of named parameters for the
callback.  Not all subclasses actually use the event name, however.
