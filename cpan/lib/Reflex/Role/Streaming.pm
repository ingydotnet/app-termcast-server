=head1 NAME

Reflex::Role::Streaming - add streaming I/O behavior to a class

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.099, released on April 21, 2013.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Moose;

	has socket => ( is => 'rw', isa => 'FileHandle', required => 1 );

	with 'Reflex::Role::Streaming' => {
		handle    => 'socket',
		cb_data   => 'on_socket_data',    # default
		cb_error  => 'on_socket_error',   # default
		cb_closed => 'on_socket_closed',  # default
	};

	sub on_socket_data {
		my ($self, $arg) = @_;
		$self->put_socket($arg->{data});
	}

	sub on_socket_error {
		my ($self, $arg) = @_;
		print "$arg->{errfun} error $arg->{errnum}: $arg->{errstr}\n";
		$self->stopped();
	}

	sub on_socket_closed {
		my $self = shift;
		print "Connection closed.\n";
		$self->stopped();
	}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Reflex::Role::Streaming is a Moose parameterized role that adds
streaming I/O behavior to Reflex-based classes.  In the SYNOPSIS, a
filehandle named "socket" is turned into a NBIO stream by the addition
addition of Reflex::Role::Streaming.

See Reflex::Stream if you prefer runtime composition with objects, or
you just find Moose syntax difficult to handle.

=head2 Required Role Parameters

=head3 handle

The C<handle> parameter must contain the name of the attribute that
contains the handle to stream.  The name indirection allows the role
to generate methods that are unique to the handle.  For example, a
handle named "XYZ" would generate these methods by default:

	cb_closed   => "on_XYZ_closed",
	cb_data     => "on_XYZ_data",
	cb_error    => "on_XYZ_error",
	method_put  => "put_XYZ",

This naming convention allows the role to be used for more than one
handle in the same class.  Each handle will have its own name, and the
mixed in methods associated with them will also be unique.

=head2 Optional Role Parameters

=head3 cb_closed

Please see L<Reflex::Role::Reading/cb_closed>.
Reflex::Role::Reading's "cb_closed" defines this callback.

=head3 cb_data

Please see L<Reflex::Role::Reading/cb_data>.
Reflex::Role::Reading's "cb_data" defines this callback.

=head3 cb_error

Please see L<Reflex::Role::Reading/cb_error>.
Reflex::Role::Reading's "cb_error" defines this callback.

=head3 method_put

C<method_put> defines the name of a method that will write data octets
to the role's handle, or buffer them if the handle can't accept them.
It's implemented in terms of Reflex::Role::Writing, and it adds code
to flush the buffer in the background using Reflex::Role::Writable.
The method created by C<method_put> returns the same value as
L<Reflex::Role::Writing/method_put> does: a status of the output
buffer after flushing is attempted.

The default name for C<method_put> is "put_" followed by the streaming
handle's name, such as put_XYZ().

The put method takes an list of strings of raw octets:

	my $pending_count = $self->put_XYZ(
		"raw octets here", " and some more"
	);

If C<method_put>'s method encounters an error, it invokes the
C<cb_error> callback before returning undef.  The C<method_put> method
returns 0 if all the data was successfully written, 1 if the buffer is
beginning to hold data, or 2 if the buffer already had data and now
has more.

=head1 EXAMPLES

TODO - I'm sure there are some.
