=head1 NAME

Reflex::Role::SigCatcher - add signal catching behavior to a class

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.099, released on April 21, 2013.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	package Reflex::Signal;

	use Moose;
	extends 'Reflex::Base';

	has signal => (
		is        => 'ro',
		isa       => 'Str',
		required  => 1,
	);

	has active => (
		is      => 'ro',
		isa     => 'Bool',
		default => 1,
	);
TODO - Changed.
	with 'Reflex::Role::SigCatcher' => {
		signal        => 'signal',
		active        => 'active',
		cb_signal     => 'on_signal',
		method_start  => 'start',
		method_stop   => 'stop',
		method_pause  => 'pause',
		method_resume => 'resume',
	};

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Reflex::Role::SigCatcher is a Moose parameterized role that adds
signal-catching behavior to Reflex based classes.  The SYNOPSIS is the
entire implementation of Reflex::SigCatcher, a simple class that
allows Reflex::Role::SigCatcher to be used as an object.

Reflex::Role::SigCatcher is not suitable for SIGCHLD use.  The
specialized Reflex::Role::PidCatcher class is used for that, and it
will automatically wait() for processes and return their exit
statuses.

=head2 Required Role Parameters

None.  All role parameters as of this writing have what we hope are
sensible defaults.  Please let us know if they don't seem all that
sensible.

=head2 Optional Role Parameters

=head3 signal

C<signal> sets the name of an attribute that will contain the signal
name to catch.  Signal names are as those found in %SIG.

TODO - However, it may also be convenient to specify the signal name
in the role's parameters.  General use cases don't usually require
signals names to change.  The indirection through C<signal> is
currently useful for Reflex::Signal, however, so we probably need
both modes.  It might be better to provide two roles, one for each
behavior, rather than one role that does both.

=head3 active

C<active> specifies whether Reflex::Role::SigCatcher should be created
in the active, signal-watching state.  All Reflex watchers are enabled
by default.  Set it to a false value, preferably 0, to initialize the
catcher in an inactive or paused mode.

Signal watchers may be paused and resumed.  See C<method_pause> and
C<method_resume> for ways to override the default method names.

=head3 cb_signal

C<cb_signal> names the $self method that will be called whenever the
signal named in C<<$self->$signal()>> is caught.  It defaults to
"on_%s_caught", where %s is the name of the signal.  So if the INT
signal is being watched, C<cb_signal> will default to "on_INT_caught".

=head3 method_start

C<method_start> sets the name of the method that may be used to
initially start catching signals.  It's "start_%s" by default, where
%s is the signal name being caught.

Reflex::Role::SigCatcher will automatically start watching for signals
if the value of C<active>'s attribute is true.

=head3 method_stop

C<method_stop> may be used to permanently stop signal catchers.
Stopped catchers cannot be restarted, so use C<method_pause> if you
need to temporarily disable signal watchers.  C<method_resume> may be
used to resume them again.

Signal catchers will automatically stop watching for signals upon
DEMOLISH.

=head3 method_pause

C<method_pause> sets the name of the method that may be used to pause
signal catching.  It is "pause_%s" by default, where %s is the signal
name being caught.

=head3 method_resume

C<method_resume> sets the name of the method that may be used to
resume signal catching.  It is "resume_%s" by default, where %s is the
signal name being caught.

=head1 EXAMPLES

eg/eg-39-signals.pl shows how Reflex::Signal may be used with
callbacks or promises.

L<Reflex::Signal> is a simple class that watches for signals with
Reflex::Role::SigCatcher.
