=head1 NAME

Reflex::Trait::EmitsOnChange - Emit an event when an attribute's value changes.

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.099, released on April 21, 2013.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	# Not a complete program.  See examples eg-09-emitter-trait.pl
	# and eg-10-setup.pl for working examples.

	package Counter;
	use Moose;
	extends 'Reflex::Base';
	use Reflex::Trait::EmitsOnChange;

	emits count => (
		isa       => 'Int',
		default   => 0,
	);

An equivalent alternative:

	has count   => (
		traits    => ['Reflex::Trait::EmitsOnChange'],
		isa       => 'Int',
		is        => 'rw',
		default   => 0,
	);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An attribute with the Reflex::Trait::EmitsOnChange trait emit an event
on behalf of its object whenever its value changes.  The event will be
named after the attribute by default.  It will be accompanied by a
"value" parameter, the value of which is the attribute's new value at
the time of the change.

In the SYNOPSIS example, changes to count() cause its Counter object
to emit "count" events.

=head2 event

The "default" option can be used to override the default event emitted
by the Reflex::Trait::EmitsOnChange trait.  That default, by the way,
is the name of the attribute.

=head2 setup

The "setup" option provides default constructor parameters for the
attribute.  In the above example, clock() will by default contain

	Reflex::Interval->new(interval => 1, auto_repeat => 1);

In other words, it will emit the Reflex::Interval event ("tick") once
per second until destroyed.

=head1 Declarative Syntax

Reflex::Trait::EmitsOnChange exports a declarative emits() function,
which acts almost identically to Moose's has() but with a couple
convenient defaults: The EmitsOnChange trait is added, and the
attribute is "rw" to allow changes.

=head1 CAVEATS

The "setup" option is a work-around for unfortunate default timing.
It will be deprecated if default can be made to work instead.
