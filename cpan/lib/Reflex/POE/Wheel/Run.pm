=head1 NAME

Reflex::POE::Wheel::Run - Represent POE::Wheel::Run as a Reflex class.

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.099, released on April 21, 2013.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Unfortunately there isn't a concise, completely executable example for
the synopsis at this time.  Please see eg-07-wheel-run.pl and
eg-08-watched-trait.pl in the distribution's eg directory for longer
but fully executable ones.

	watches child => (
		isa => 'Reflex::POE::Wheel::Run|Undef',
	);

	sub BUILD {
		my $self = shift;
		$self->child(
			Reflex::POE::Wheel::Run->new(
				Program => "$^X -wle 'print qq[pid(\$\$) moo(\$_)] for 1..10; exit'",
			)
		);
	}

	sub on_child_stdout {
		my ($self, $event) = @_;
		print "stdout: ", $event->output(), "\n";
	}

	sub on_child_close {
		my ($self, $event) = @_;
		print "child closed all output\n";
	}

	sub on_child_signal {
		my ($self, $event) = @_;
		print "child ", $event->pid(), " exited: ", $event->exit(), "\n";
		$self->child(undef);
	}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Reflex::POE::Wheel::Run represents an enhanced POE::Wheel::Run object.
It will manage a child process, and it will also wait for (and report
on) the corresponding SIGCHLD.

This module delegates to L<POE::Wheel::Run> for most of its
implementation.  Please refer to that module for implementation
details.

=head2 Public Methods

This class adds public methods specific to POE::Wheel::Run's
operation.  However, common methods like put() are both implemented
and documented in the base L<Reflex::POE::Wheel> class.

=head3 kill

kill() passes its arguments to POE::Wheel::Run's kill() method.

=head2 Public Events

Objects of this class emit all of POE::Wheel::Run's events, albeit
renamed into Reflex-friendly forms.  Generally these forms are
determined by removing the "Event" suffix and lowercasing what
remains.  POE::Wheel::Run's StdinEvent becomes "stdin", and so on.

=head3 stdin

See POE::Wheel::Run's StdinEvent.  Within Reflex, this event comes
with only one parameter: "wheel_id".  This is the POE::Wheel::Run
object's ID.

=head3 stdout

See POE::Wheel::Run's StdoutEvent.  Reflex includes two parameters:
"wheel_id" and "output".  The latter parameter contains data the child
process wrote to its STDOUT handle.

=head3 stderr

See POE::Wheel::Run's StderrEvent.  Reflex includes two parameters:
"wheel_id" and "output".  The latter parameter contains data the child
process wrote to its STDERR handle.

=head3 error

See POE::Wheel::Run's ErrorEvent.  Reflex maps the wheel's parameters
to: "operation", "errnum", "errstr", "wheel_id" and "handle_name",
respectively.

=head3 closed

See POE::Wheel::Run's CloseEvent.  Reflex includes only one parameter
for this event: "wheel_id".

=head1 CAVEATS

This class could further be improved so that it doesn't report SIGCHLD
until all the child's output has been received and processed.  This
would resolve a long-standing nondeterminism in the timing of
on_child_close() vs. on_child_signal().
