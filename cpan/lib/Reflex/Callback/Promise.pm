=head1 NAME

Reflex::Callback::Promise - Non-callback, inline Promise adapter

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.099, released on April 21, 2013.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Used within Reflex:

	use Reflex::Interval;
	use ExampleHelpers qw(eg_say);

	my $pt = Reflex::Interval->new(
		interval    => 1 + rand(),
		auto_repeat => 1,
	);

	while (my $event = $pt->next()) {
		eg_say("promise timer returned an event (@$event)");
	}

Low-level usage:

	use Reflex::Callback::Promise;

	my $cb = Reflex::Callback::Promise->new();
	$cb->deliver( greet => { name => "world" } );

	my $event = $cb->next();
	print "event '$event->{name}': hello, $event->{arg}{name}\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

"In computer science, future, promise, and delay refer to constructs
used for synchronization in some concurrent programming languages.
They describe an object that acts as a proxy for a result that is
initially not known, usually because the computation of its value has
not yet completed." --
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promise_%28programming%29

Reflex::Callback::Promise enables Reflex objects to be used as inline
event streams.  Reflex::Callback::Promise and Reflex::Role::Reactive
transparently handle the conversion.  Reflex objects do not need
special code to be used this way.

In most cases, Reflex::Callbacks::cb_promise() or other syntactic
sweeteners will be used instead of raw Reflex::Callback::Promise
objects.  For example, promises are implicitly enabled if no callbacks
are defined:

	my $t = Reflex::Interval->new(
		interval    => 1,
		auto_repeat => 1,
	);

	while (my $event = $t->next()) {
		print "next() returned an event\n";
	}

=head2 new

Reflex::Callback::Promise's constructor takes no parameters.  It
creates a promise queue that is populated by deliver() and drained by
next().  Furthermore, next() will block as necessary until it can
return an event.  This requires the help of some form of concurrency,
currently hardcoded to use POE.

A future version may delegate the POE dependency to a subclass.

=head2 next

Reflex::Callback::Promise's next() method retrieves the next pending
event held in the object's queue.  If the queue is empty, next() will
dispatch other events until some asynchronous code enqueues a new event
in the promise's queue.

=head2 deliver

Reflex::Callback::Promise's deliver() enqueues events for the promise.
As with other Reflex::Callback subclasses, this deliver() accepts two
positional parameters: an event name (which IS used), and a hashref of
named parameters to be passed to the callback.

Deliver doesn't return anything meaningful, since the code to handle
the event isn't executed at the time of delivery.
