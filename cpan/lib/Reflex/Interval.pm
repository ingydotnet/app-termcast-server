=head1 NAME

Reflex::Interval - A stand-alone multi-shot periodic callback

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.099, released on April 21, 2013.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

As with all Reflex objects, Reflex::Interval may be used in many
different ways.

Inherit it and override its on_tick() callback, with or without using
Moose.

	package App;
	use Reflex::Interval;
	use base qw(Reflex::Interval);

	sub on_tick {
		print "tick at ", scalar(localtime), "...\n";
		shift()->repeat();
	}

Run it as a promise that generates periodic events.  All other Reflex
objects will also be running while C<<$pt->next()>> is blocked.

	my $pt = Reflex::Interval->new(
		interval    => 1 + rand(),
		auto_repeat => 1,
	);

	while (my $event = $pt->next()) {
		eg_say("promise timer returned an event ($event->{name})");
	}

Plain old callbacks:

	my $ct = Reflex::Interval->new(
		interval    => 1,
		auto_repeat => 1,
		on_tick     => sub { print "coderef callback triggered\n" },
	);
	Reflex->run_all();

And so on.  See Reflex, Reflex::Base and Reflex::Role::Reactive for
details.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Reflex::Interval invokes a callback after a specified interval of time
has passed, and then after every subsequent interval of time.
Interval timers may be stopped and started.  Their timers may be
automatically or manually repeated.
