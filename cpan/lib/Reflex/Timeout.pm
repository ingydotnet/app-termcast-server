=head1 NAME

Reflex::Timeout - A stand-alone single-shot delayed callback

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.099, released on April 21, 2013.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	#!/usr/bin/env perl

	use warnings;
	use strict;

	use Reflex::Timeout;

	my $to = Reflex::Timeout->new(
		delay   => 1,
		on_done => \&handle_timeout,
	);

	Reflex->run_all();
	exit;

	sub handle_timeout {
		print "got timeout\n";
		$to->reset();
	}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Reflex::Timeout invokes a callback after a specified amount of time
has elapsed.  Timeouts may be stopped, restarted, or reset so they
must again wait the full delay period.  Resetting is especially
useful, for example whenever input arrives.
